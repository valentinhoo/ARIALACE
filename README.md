In the pursuit of effective deforestation monitoring, a cutting-edge drone system has been developed, combining advanced technologies seamlessly. This drone utilizes YOLO v8 for real-time object detection, an ESP32 Cam for image capture, and MultiWii as its flight controller. This integration empowers the drone to autonomously identify deforestation activities and provide vital data to aid conservation efforts.

It uses an esp32-cam for video input which is then fed into a yolov8 model trained on custom dataset of deforestation and uses an arduino nano running multiwii as its flight controller to keep the cost down
