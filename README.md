Aerial Ace is a cost-effective AI-powered drone system that autonomously monitors forests to detect illegal deforestation and early wildfire signs in real time. Using an ESP32-CAM with a YOLOv8 model and Arduino Nano flight controller, it sends instant alerts with location and visuals, enabling faster response to protect forests and wildlife.
